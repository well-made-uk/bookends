title: Touch
---

maybe it makes me feel alive

maybe it tells me that I am worthy

or special

or trusted by someone

or worthy of being trusted by someone

maybe it reminds me that

I am in control now

I get to choose who I touch and

how I touch them

maybe I want to be split in half

like a geode, and be reborn

maybe I just want to learn something

or share something new

maybe all I want is to connect

with another
